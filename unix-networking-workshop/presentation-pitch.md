Learn about Unix and the Internet in one hour!

I found that, unlike for web frameworks or machine learning, there aren't really any good, *quick* learning resources for networking and operating systems that give you an overview and some tools to get started. Hence this workshop. We'll cover just enough to make you more comfortable with dealing with the internet, even if (and especially if) you never actually plan to do any lower-level coding yourself.

**You should attend if**:
- you heard of/worked with concepts like `http`/`tcp`/`port`/`socket`/`posix`/etc a hundred times, but don't quite know what they mean
- you think that lower-level OS/networking stuff is intimidating

**You should also attend if**:
- you want to learn more about how your \*nix operating system works (be it OSX, Linux, or something else)
- you have written an application that interacts with the internet in a high-level language like Python or Ruby, and want to know how it works under the hood
- you want to learn about lower-level OS/networking stuff, but don't know where to start

(We will explore what happens between the tcp and http layers using tools like netstat/lsof/telnet/ifconfig and some Python)
